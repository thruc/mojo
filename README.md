# Welcome to Mojo

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research 
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems 
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still early, but it is designed
to become a superset of 
Python over time.  This will allow Python's dynamic features to continue
to shine but also unleash Python from the shackles of C and C++ under the hood.

We expect Mojo to be open-sourced progressively over time, but for now it's still 
young and changing very quickly. We believe that a small,tight-knit group of 
engineers with a shared vision can move faster than a community effort, so we will
continue to incubate it within Modular until it's more complete.  Please see the 
[Mojo FAQ](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/faq.html)for answers to this and other 
common questions. 

We've opened this repo now because we want to gather issues and engage in feedback 
from users who have access to the Mojo Playground (our hosted JupyterHub
where you can try coding with an early version of Mojo). To get access to the
Mojo Playground, [see here to sign up](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/get-started.html).
Then, when you want to report issues or request features,
[please create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues).
